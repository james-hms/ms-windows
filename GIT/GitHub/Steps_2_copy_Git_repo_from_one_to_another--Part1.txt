I did the 'copy', not move!  

steps ( I did, were 5.5 to 10 )

USERID_VSTS   - your userid in VSTS
token         - personal access token ( VSTS )

USERID_GH     - your userid in GitHub
token2        - personal access token ( GitHub )

-----

5.5   git clone --mirror  https://USERID_VSTS:token@dev.azure.com/hmsholdings/eCare/_git/eCare_UI  temp-directory
      cd temp-directory

6.    git tag
      git branch -a

7.    git remote rm origin

8.    git remote add origin https://USERID_GH:token2@github.com/hmsholdings/cav-ecare-ui.git

9.    git remote -v       ( Shows URLs of remote repositories )

10.   git push origin --all
      git push --tags

11.   DO A PULL REQUEST!    (so master branch gets updated, with correct branch)

      DevOps corrects this, because 'master' branch is empty, and thus we can't do the merge on our own.  (too different)
      (DevOps deletes the blank, master branch, places it with your branch)
