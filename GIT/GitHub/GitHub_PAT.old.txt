Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password 
for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

How to solve it
To solve this problem all we need to do is create a GitHub personal access token and use it 
instead of our GitHub password and a two-factor authentication code.

Creating a GitHub personal access token.

In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.

In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.

Click Generate new token.

Give your token a descriptive name.

Select the scopes, or permissions, you’d like to grant this token. To use your token to 
access repositories from the command line, select repo.

Click Generate token.

Copy the token to your clipboard. For security reasons, after you navigate off the page, 
you will not be able to see the token again.
